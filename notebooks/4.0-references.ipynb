In this dataset, the author has attempted to collect as many samples as possible, but it seems that there are still many missing cases. Additionally, the \"smoking status\" column contains a lot of missing data and values that are labeled as unknown, which makes this column prone to bias. Furthermore, the disproportionate ratio between the number of stroke and non-stroke samples makes the analysis more difficult."

Through this final project, I have gained more knowledge about the risk of stroke and increased awareness of the dangers of stroke. Additionally, in this project, I have learned more about the data science processes, data preprocessing techniques prior to analysis, and how to effectively communicate data through visualizations to provide a comprehensive and easily understandable overview. Finally, I have also explored various models that are widely applied in the current context."
