### II. Introduction

- Strokes are an important preventable cause of death and disability on over the world. Nearly 800,000 people in the United States suffer from a stroke each year, with about three in four being first-time strokes. Especially, Vietnam experiences around 200,000 cases of stroke annually, and similar to other chronic diseases, this number is on an upward trend.
- In this project, we focus on researching the relationships between strokes and factors such as genders, age, as well as medical history, including high blood pressure, smoking, and others.
